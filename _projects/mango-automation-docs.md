I'm building the new documentation website for Mango Automation. This project is based on the [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 
and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

We decided to use [Statamic](https://statamic.com/) because it provides a lot of flexibility when you need to manage content,
and let other non-technical persons to edit the content as well. The site support different languages. We manage the search
with [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).

This project is still in development.
