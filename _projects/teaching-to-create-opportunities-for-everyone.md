Since my university days I have liked teaching others, sharing my knowledge and providing contributions based on my experience that stimulate people to acquire more knowledge, to develop an entrepreneurial sense, to enter the field of technology and innovation, especially to the younger generations who are the most important factor for the growth of a country.

In my quest to share my knowledge with others, I met a person with a lot of experience living and working in the field of technology around the world, who had returned to Venezuela with the idea of ​​teaching (for free) to young millennials the "Why" it was necessary to "learn to work for the planet" and "how" to train yourself to achieve it.

The idea of ​​this person (today my friend) was to create workshops, through a non-profit organization, to search for talents, train them in new technologies and learn to work for the world.

I joined the non-profit organization, called "T123", and I was an instructor on technology issues for two (02) years. During my participation as an instructor I taught courses on:

- Laravel
- Git
- React JS
- Vue JS
- Tailwind CSS
- Mango Automation Software

The courses were given totally free on Saturdays, in an empty apartment that my friend had in the city of Caracas. The minimum duration of a course was four (04) hours. We implement classes under a “train the trainers” program, we reach more than three thousand (3000) young people, from different social classes and ranging in age from fourteen (14) to twenty-five (25) years old.

This experience taught me that by teaching other you learn a lot. Also, you need to be able to teach your knowledge, so you can move on to the next challenge together, and not alone!
