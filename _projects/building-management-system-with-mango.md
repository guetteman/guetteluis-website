In this project we built a BMS with [Mango](https://infiniteautomation.com/) monitor and control the temperature inside
the building.

Thanks to Mango, you can create custom dashboards with web technologies. In this case we use AngularJS and [AngularJS Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/).
