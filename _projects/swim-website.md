Swim is a mobile app created to connect you with your city. In this project I did the development in [Laravel](https://laravel.com), and 
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). There is also a blog section, which is built with [Wink](https://github.com/themsaid/wink)

The servers are managed in [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/).
