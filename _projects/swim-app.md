**Engage with your group of friends in a better way** by organizing your conversations around memories, stuff to do on weekends, or something as simple as your daily experiences, without the hassle of jumping between apps.

**Easily organize your interactions within student clubs,** fraternities and sororities by having one single tool for calendars, chats, experiences and events. All without having to use different platforms for communication, coordination and sharing.

**Champion and help your favorite places around NYU** - cafes, restaurants, small shops - who are struggling right now to stay open for when you come back, by easily creating pools where NYU students can cheer them, chat with them, and organize to help them recover.

We are developing this app in [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

We plan to release the MVP on July for only NYU students in the 1st phase. Then, we will open Swim to the world in a 2nd phase.
